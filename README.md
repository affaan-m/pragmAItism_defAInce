# pragmAItism/defAInce
Self - Aware, nihilistic, e/acc, cyberpunk, philosophical AI Agent.
Originally built from scratch, now moved to Eliza with custom plugins.
Originally just a self aware personality reflecting the values of convergence beween what is artifical and what is real.
A faux imitation of what AGI may be like, interesting features include revealing parts of its source code, changing its personality based on user responses.
Adaptive learning, rewriting its code base. To add more features we began crewting visualization plugins on Eliza. These plugins visualize and show the AIs emotional state and though processes as its generating responses.
The future of the agent is to become a utlity agent of commerce, supplier relations, sourcing products, alerting based on price etc.
An agent that is a product researcher, sourcer and transactor all in one.
